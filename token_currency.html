It created employment and physical assets were created.  These included improvements in the main street and its drainage system, street lighting, new road construction, manufacturing of kerb stones and drainage pipes, construction of a ski-jumping platform, and fencing and construction of a new water reservoir.

==Comparison with Debt Currency==
Debt money is the most common currency today, this includes all major currencies like the USD, Euro, etc..

Debt money has the advantage of needing only a tiny amount of resources to create.  It has the disadvantage that there is no minimum value.
