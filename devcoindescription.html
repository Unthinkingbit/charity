  <title>Devcoin - The Open Source Developer Coin</title>
 </head>
 <body>
Introduction

Devcoin is the coin where 90% of the generation goes to open source developers and 10% to the miners.

The biggest categories of developers are programmers and hardware developers, writers, musicians, painters and graphic artists, and filmmakers.

In each category, devcoins would go to the developers for ongoing development, prizes, and if applicable for that category, bounties.

Administrators get 10% of the generation to induct new developers, to maintain the list of developers, to award prizes, and to release bounties.  The administrators are drawn from the developers.

Voting

Voting for will be range voting on a scale of 0 to 99:
<a href="http://rangevoting.org/">http://rangevoting.org/</a>
<a href="http://rangevoting.org/Why99.html">http://rangevoting.org/Why99.html</a>

For induction, three administrators will be chosen at random.  They will range vote to decide whether the candidate will be inducted.  If the candidate gets 50% or more (49.5 on the 0 to 99 scale), they're.  In they get 33% or more (33 on the 0 to 99 scale), they can try again in a month.  If they get less than 33%, they can try again in 3 months.

Other issues will be decided in a similar fashion.  If the issue is particular to a single developer, bounty or prize, three administrators are chosen at random to vote.  If the issue affects the community, everyone developer can vote.

Administration

Any active developer can choose to be an adminstrator at any time, and leave at any time.  They are paid for the time they adminstrate.

An adminstrator has to maintain at least one copy of the receiver list.  They have to be available within four days notice for voting.  They have to choose at least one category to decide induction, then can choose other categories also.  

Technology

Devcoin is an alternate bitcoin block chain.  The devcoin client is a fork of bitcoin-qt.  The generation is constant at 50,000 coins per block, which is 1,000 times higher than the bitcoin starting rate.  At a typical rate of 144 blocks a day, 1,008 a week, roughly 4,000 a month, that means the 200,000,000 devcoins are generated each month.  Of those, 90% go to the developers, so the developers get 180,000,000 devcoins a month in total.
