  <title>Devcoin - The Open Source Developer Coin</title>
</head>
<body>
Introduction<br>
<br>
Devcoin is the coin where 90% of the generation goes to open source
developers and 10% to the miners.<br>
<br>
The biggest categories of developers are programmers and hardware
developers, writers, musicians, painters and graphic artists, and
filmmakers.<br>
<br>
In each category, devcoins would go to the developers for ongoing
development, and if applicable for that category, bounties.<br>
<br>
Administrators get 10% of the generation to induct new developers, to
maintain the list of receivers, and to release bounties. The
administrators are drawn from the developers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Purpose<br>
<br>
The purpose of the devcoin is to give money to open source developers
for their work in as fair a manner as possible.<br>
<br>
Many open source developers do not get a significant amount of money
for their work. Advertising, charity and sometimes consulting provide
some income, but many developers, even those with projects used by
several thousand people, only get a few dollars a month. In a typical
economy, in the ballpark of 1% goes to charity. That is not enough to
support people.<br>
<br>
Because developers get so little, they can only develop their projects
in their spare time, which makes development really slow. Feature
requests and critiques do not accelerate development, money will.<br>
<br>
Devcoins provide an income for everyone who wants to work, even if they
live in an area with more job seekers than jobs. With devcoin, no one
who wants to work need be completely out of money. Anyone who does good
work will get some devcoins. There is no guarantee that this will be a
high income, but something is way better than nothing.<br>
<br>
By buying devcoins you help developers and give the world more open
source software, books, music, art, and movies.<br>
<br>
<br>
Categories<br>
<br>
Licenses for programming and hardware which qualify for devcoins are
the AGPL, Apache, BSD, GPL, LGPL, MIT, public domain, and unlicense.
Licenses for writers, musicians, painters and graphic artists, and
filmmakers which qualify for devcoins are the Creative Commons Share
Alike (wikipedia license), Creative Commons Attribution, public domain,
and unlicense.<br>
<br>
Programmers and hardware developers includes, but is not limited to,
people who develop open source software, websites, machinery, circuits,
vehicles, housing, games, medicine, and transportation, energy and
resource extraction systems.<br>
<br>
Writers includes people who write books, articles, fiction, poetry, and
documentation. Fan fiction only qualifies if the source license also
qualifies for devcoins.<br>
<br>
The musicians category includes people who perform music and people who
create or record unique sounds.<br>
<br>
The painters and graphic artists category does not currently include
photographers because photography can be done mechanically with little
or no creative work.<br>
<br>
The filmmakers category includes people who make movies, shorts, and
animation. Fan films only qualify if the source license also qualifies
for devcoins.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bounties<br>
<br>
The initial bounties are for making a web site where all devcoin
qualifying writing could be uploaded. The web site would have limited
advertising (only text ads or a single non animated banner ad), which
would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed among
the writers. The next bounty is for an open source devcoin block
explorer.<br>
<br>
The medium term bounties are for a forum site which requires bitcoins /
devcoins to join and post, the money would support the site, any
remaining income would be distributed according to the wishes of the
posters. A web email which requires coins to join and post, the money
would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed to
charity. Software upgrades to the mainline client to make it more
difficult to double spend. Software changes to the mainline client to
make it easier to make alternative clients. Expansion of the devcoin
writer web site to also host music, art and movies.<br>
<br>
In the long term, bounties for improvements of open source software in
general. Bounties for open source machinery, circuits, vehicles,
housing, games and medicine. Bounties for open source villages and
other types of communities. Bounties for open source transportation,
energy and resource extraction systems. The ultimate purpose of the
bounties is to fund all kinds of open source development, so that
people could choose to live in an open source community where
everything therein could be developed or built by anyone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Active Developer<br>
<br>
If you actively develop open source of any kind, you can apply to get a
share of devcoin generation by posting in an induction thread, like:<br>
https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=18498<br>
<br>
Your candidacy would then be voted on, usually within a week. Depending
on the vote you would either be inducted or you could try again after a
certain time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Voting<br>
<br>
Voting for will be range voting on a scale of 0 to 99:<br>
<a href="http://rangevoting.org/">http://rangevoting.org/</a>
<a href="http://rangevoting.org/Why99.html">http://rangevoting.org/Why99.html</a><br>
<br>
<br>
For induction, three administrators will be chosen at random. They will
range vote to decide whether the candidate will be inducted. If the
candidate gets 50% or more (49.5 on the 0 to 99 scale), they're. In
they get 33% or more (33 on the 0 to 99 scale), they can try again in a
month. If they get less than 33%, they can try again in 3 months.
Other issues will be decided in a similar fashion. If the issue is
particular to a single developer, bounty or prize, three administrators
are chosen at random to vote. If the issue affects the community, every
active developer can vote.<br>
<br>
<br>
Administration<br>
<br>
Any active developer can choose to be an adminstrator at any time, and
leave at any time. They are paid for the time they administrate.
An administrator has to maintain at least one copy of the receiver
list. They have to be available within four days notice for voting.
They have to choose at least one category to vote on inductees.
The administrators get 10% of the devcoins as payment for their work
and for being available for voting.<br>
<br>
<br>
Technical<br>
<br>
Devcoin is an alternate bitcoin block chain. The devcoin client is a
fork of bitcoin-qt. The generation is constant at 50,000 coins per
block, which is 1,000 times higher than the bitcoin starting rate. At a
typical rate of 144 blocks a day, 1,008 a week, roughly 4,000 a month,
that means the 200,000,000 devcoins are generated each month. Of those,
90% go to the developers, so the developers get 180,000,000 devcoins a
month in total.<br>

Receiver.h will first look for the receiver_2.csv file.  Since it's not there it will step down and look for receiver_1.csv.  Still not there so it looks for and finds receiver_0.csv.  It then downloads receiver_1.csv by looking at the peers in receiver_0.csv and saves in the data directory.  It then downloads receiver_2.csv by looking at the peers in receiver_1.csv and saves in the data directory.  Once it has receiver_2.csv, it parses it to get the list of receivers and uses height modulo list length to return the receivers for height 9000.<br><br>Receiver also looks ahead, after it is a random portion between 0.75 and roughly 0.95 of the way to the next step so that there is no mass downloading when the block height switches from x999 to x000.  To resist ddos attacks and to work even when some web sites are down, it picks the page which the majority of peers have available.  The step size of 4000 gives an update roughly each month.<br><br>The constants required for the subsidy are changed and constants for share, and fallback reduction are added:<br><br>static const int64 initialSubsidy = 50000 * COIN;<br>static const int64 share = initialSubsidy * 9 / 10;<br>static const int64 fallbackReduction = (initialSubsidy + share) / 2;<br><br>Code in GetBlockValue is changed:<br><br>//int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;<br>int64 nSubsidy = initialSubsidy;<br><br>There has been talk about shifting the decimal place in bitcoin, because a maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins would lead to people having to deal in milliBitcoins if bitcoin gets really popular.  However, once a block chain is made, it is really difficult to change the value of the currency.  So even though people will generally want to move the decimal place, it would be not be done and people would be stuck with an awkward currency unit.  In the 'RFC: SI-type of naming convention for BTC' thread a lot of the problems people have dealing with a large currency unit are discussed:<br>http://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=9299.0<br><br>Since devcoin is a new currency, it is easy to multiply the coins by 1,000.

Random numbers for voting are determined by a hash of the string
composed of the name of the person and the next block of the highest
difficulty block chain, which at the time of this writing is bitcoin.
For consecutive random numbers, the next number is the hash of the
string doubled and so on. For example, say someone applies to be
accepted as an active developer. When they post their application, the
hash of their name and the next block after their post is combined to
make a string. The hexadecimal hash of that string is used as a number
from zero to one, multiplied by the number of administrators, to get
the first administrator. The hexadecimal hash of the doubled string is
multiplied by the number of remaining adminstrators, to get the second
administrator. The hash of the tripled string is multiplied by the
remaining, to get the third administrator.<br>
<br>
<br>
Concerns<br>
<br>
The primary concern is that in the long term, most organizations become
corrupt, regardless of the intentions of the founders. The single best
defense against the corruption of an organization is competition.
Devcoin would be the first currency to give part of its generation to
developers. However, developers are welcome to fork it in turn, and
create say a reformcoin, that also gives generation to developers, but
starts with another set of founders. If the reformcoin is less corrupt
than devcoin, people will sell the devcoin and buy reformcoins. Even if
most people remain with devcoin, just the possibility that people could
move to reformcoin will tend to rein in the corruption of the devcoin.
To increase the availability of competition, there will be bounties for
software to easily make alternate currencies derived from devcoin, and
bounties for easy to use range voting software. This would also make it
easier for people to make other coins like town coins and project coins.<br>
<br>
To further reduce corruption, all meetings and votes will be public,
because sunshine is the best disinfectant. Everyone would be able to
post on every thread; however since without a postage fee this would
lead to enormous spam and trolling, a fee of up to 0.05$/post along
with an entry fee of 5$ (which prepays for posts) is acceptable. Also,
people could rate posters and those lists could be used by forum
participants, or people looking at the forum records, to screen out
trolls. Because the value of the $ varies, for this document a $ is
defined as being 1 / 25,000 of the median of the median income of the
top 20 countries ranked by median income with a population over one
million.<br>
<br>
Because miners get only 10% of the coins, the difficulty will be 10%
that of a bitcoin type chain of equal value. So double spending attacks
will be much easier. To protect against this, bounties will be offered
for upgrades to the mainline client to make it more difficult to double
spend.<br>
<br>
For active developers, their receive key will a large portion of their
devcoins, and if that key was lost or stolen they would suffer
terribly. So the almoner software will be upgraded to handle a list of
keys. There will also be bounties for software and hardware key
generators.<br>
