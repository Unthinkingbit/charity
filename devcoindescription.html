  <title>Devcoin - The Open Source Developer Coin</title>
 </head>
 <body>
Introduction

Devcoin is the coin where 90% of the generation goes to open source developers and 10% to the miners.

The biggest categories of developers are programmers and hardware developers, writers, musicians, painters and graphic artists, and filmmakers.

In each category, devcoins would go to the developers for ongoing development, and if applicable for that category, bounties.

Administrators get 10% of the generation to induct new developers, to maintain the list of receivers, and to release bounties.  The administrators are drawn from the developers.


Purpose

The purpose of the devcoin is to give money to open source developers in as fair a manner as possible.

Many open source developers do not get a significant amount of money for their work.  Advertising, charity and sometimes consulting provide some income, but many developers, even those with projects used by several thousand people, only get a few dollars a month.  In a typical economy, in the ballpark of 1% goes to charity.  That is not enough to support people.

Because developers get so little, they can only develop their projects in their spare time, which makes development really slow.  Feature requests and critiques do not accelerate development, money will.

Devcoins provide an income for everyone who wants to work, even if they live in an area with more job seekers than jobs.  With devcoin, no one who wants to work need be completely out of money.  Anyone who does good work will get some devcoins.  There is no guarantee that this will be a high income, but something is way better than nothing.

By buying devcoins you help developers and give the world more open source software, books, music, art, and movies.


Categories

Programmers and hardware developers includes, but is not limited to, people who develop open source software, websites, machinery, circuits, vehicles, housing, games and medicine.  Licenses which qualify for devcoins are the AGPL, Apache, BSD, GPL, LGPL, MIT, and public domain.

Writers includes people who write books, articles, fiction, poetry, and documentation.  Licenses which qualify for devcoins are the Creative Commons Share Alike (wikipedia license), Creative Commons Attribution, unlicense, and public domain.  Fan fiction only qualifies if the source license also qualifies for devcoins.

The musicians category includes people who perform music and people who create or record unique sounds.  Licenses which qualify for devcoins are the Creative Commons Share Alike (wikipedia license), Creative Commons Attribution, unlicense, and public domain.

The painters and graphic artists category does not currently include photographers because photography can be done mechanically with little or no creative work.  Licenses which qualify for devcoins are the Creative Commons Share Alike (wikipedia license), Creative Commons Attribution, unlicense, and public domain.

The filmmakers category includes people who make movies, shorts, and animation.  Licenses which qualify for devcoins are the Creative Commons Share Alike (wikipedia license), Creative Commons Attribution, unlicense, and public domain.  Fan films only qualify if the source license also qualifies for devcoins.

Bounties

The initial bounties are for the first five inductees in the programmer and hardware category, and the first five in the writer category.  Also there is a bounty for making a web site where all devcoin qualifying writing can be uploaded.  The web site would have limited advertising (only text ads or a single non animated banner ad), which would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed among the contributors.

Ongoing Development

If you actively develop open source software, you can apply to get a share of devcoin generation by posting in an induction thread, like:
https://forum.bitcoin.org/index.php?topic=18498

Your candidacy would then be voted on, usually within a week.  Depending on the vote you would either be inducted or you could try again after a certain time.


Voting

Voting for will be range voting on a scale of 0 to 99:
<a href="http://rangevoting.org/">http://rangevoting.org/</a>
<a href="http://rangevoting.org/Why99.html">http://rangevoting.org/Why99.html</a>

For induction, three administrators will be chosen at random.  They will range vote to decide whether the candidate will be inducted.  If the candidate gets 50% or more (49.5 on the 0 to 99 scale), they're.  In they get 33% or more (33 on the 0 to 99 scale), they can try again in a month.  If they get less than 33%, they can try again in 3 months.

Other issues will be decided in a similar fashion.  If the issue is particular to a single developer, bounty or prize, three administrators are chosen at random to vote.  If the issue affects the community, every active developer can vote.


Administration

Any active developer can choose to be an adminstrator at any time, and leave at any time.  They are paid for the time they adminstrate.

An administrator has to maintain at least one copy of the receiver list.  They have to be available within four days notice for voting.  They have to choose at least one category to vote on inductees.


Technology

Devcoin is an alternate bitcoin block chain.  The devcoin client is a fork of bitcoin-qt.  The generation is constant at 50,000 coins per block, which is 1,000 times higher than the bitcoin starting rate.  At a typical rate of 144 blocks a day, 1,008 a week, roughly 4,000 a month, that means the 200,000,000 devcoins are generated each month.  Of those, 90% go to the developers, so the developers get 180,000,000 devcoins a month in total.

The sending code in CreateBlock looks like:

	vector<string> coinAddressStrings = getCoinAddressStrings(GetDataDir(), string("receiver.csv"), (int)pindexPrev->nHeight+1);
    txNew.vout.resize(coinAddressStrings.size() + 1);
    txNew.vout[0].scriptPubKey << reservekey.GetReservedKey() << OP_CHECKSIG;
    int64 minerValue = GetBlockValue(pindexPrev->nHeight+1, nFees);
	int64 sharePerAddress = 0;
	if (coinAddressStrings.size() == 0)
		minerValue -= fallbackReduction;
	else
		sharePerAddress = share / (int64)coinAddressStrings.size();
    for (int i=0; i<coinAddressStrings.size(); i++)
    {
        // Create transaction
        uint160 hash160 = 0;
        if(!AddressToHash160(coinAddressStrings[i], hash160))
        {
            return NULL;
        }

        txNew.vout[i + 1].scriptPubKey << OP_DUP << OP_HASH160 << hash160 << OP_EQUALVERIFY << OP_CHECKSIG;
        txNew.vout[i + 1].nValue = sharePerAddress;
        minerValue -= sharePerAddress
    }
..
//    pblock->vtx[0].vout[0].nValue = GetBlockValue(pindexPrev->nHeight+1, nFees);
    txNew.vout[0].nValue = minerValue + nFees;

The validation code in ConnectBlock needs the addition of:

	//
	// Check that the required share was sent to each beneficiary
	//
	if (vtx[0].GetValueOut() > (GetBlockValue(pindex->nHeight, nFees) - fallbackReduction))
	{
		std::vector<std::string> addressStrings;
		std::vector<int64> amounts;

		for (int i = 1; i < vtx[0].vout.size(); i++)
		{
			addressStrings.push_back(vtx[0].vout[i].scriptPubKey.GetBitcoinAddress());
			amounts.push_back(vtx[0].vout[i].nValue);
		}

		if (!getIsSufficientAmount(addressStrings, amounts, GetDataDir(), string("receiver.csv"), (int)pindex->nHeight, share))
			return error("ConnectBlock() : Share to beneficiary is insufficient");
	}

Receiver.h accesses a synchronized list of receivers:
https://raw.github.com/Unthinkingbit/charity/master/receiver.h

For example, say the devcoin client requests the height 9000 receivers, the height step is 4000 and only the root receiver_0.csv saved.  Receiver.h will first look for the receiver_2.csv.  Since it's not there it will step down and look for receiver_1.csv.  Still not there so it looks for and finds receiver_0.csv.  It then downloads and saves in the data directory; receiver_1.csv by looking at the peers in receiver_0.csv.  It then downloads and saves in the data directory; receiver_2.csv by looking at the peers in receiver_1.csv.  Once it has receiver_2.csv, it parses it to get the list of receivers and uses height modulo list length to return the receivers for 9000.

Receiver also looks ahead after it is a random portion between 0.75 and roughly 0.95 of the next step so that there is no mass downloading when the block height switches from x999 to x000.  To resist ddos attacks and to work even when some web sites are down, it picks the page which the majority of peers have available.  The step size of 4000 gives an update roughly each month.

The constants required for the share, subsidy, and fallback reduction are changed:

static const int64 initialSubsidy = 50000 * COIN;
static const int64 share = initialSubsidy * 9 / 10;
static const int64 fallbackReduction = (initialSubsidy + share) / 2;

The constants for the transaction fees and max money are changed:

//static const int64 MIN_TX_FEE = 50000;
static const int64 MIN_TX_FEE = 50000000;
//static const int64 MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 10000;
static const int64 MIN_RELAY_TX_FEE = 10000000;
//static const int64 MAX_MONEY = 21000000 * COIN;
static const int64 MAX_MONEY = 21000000000 * COIN;

Code in GetBlockValue is changed:

//int64 nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
int64 nSubsidy = initialSubsidy;

CENT was replaced by the MIN_TX_FEE wherever the min transaction fee was meant to be used.


Concerns

The primary concern is that in the long term, most organizations become corrupt, regardless of the intentions of the founders.  The single best defense against the corruption of an organization is competition.  Devcoin would be the first currency to give part of its generation to developers.  However, developers are welcome to fork it in turn, and create say a reformcoin, that also gives generation to developers, but starts with another set of founders.  If the reformcoin is less corrupt than devcoin, people will sell the devcoin and buy reformcoins.  Even if most people remain with devcoin, just the possibility that people could move to reformcoin will tend to rein in the corruption of the devcoin.  To increase the availability of competition, there will be bounties for software to easily make alternate currencies derived from devcoin, and bounties for easy to use range voting software.  This would also make it easier for people to make other coins like town coins, and project coins.
