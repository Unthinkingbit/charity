There were 369 original receiver lines, so the average number of devcoins per share is 180,000,000 dvc / 369 = 487,805 dvc. Administrator pay is 45.0 shares, 12.2 percent of the total. The value at vircurex is 0.195 mcbtc/dvc, which works out to 0.0951 btc. This times the bitstamp price of 805$ gives a share price of 77$.

People on that list will start getting those coins in round 29, starting at block 116,000. The procedure for generating the receiver files is at:
