There were 669 original receiver lines, so the average number of devcoins per share is 180,000,000 dvc / 669 = 269,058 dvc. Administrator pay is 54.0 shares, 8.1 percent of the total.

People on that list will start getting those coins in round 25, starting at block 100,000. The procedure for generating the receiver files is at:
