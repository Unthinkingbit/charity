<title>Devcoin Bounty</title></head>
<body>
Introduction<br>
<br>
Devcoin is an ethical currency where 90% of the generation goes to open source developers and about a quarter of that will go to bounties.<br>
<br>
The bounties will be primarily for development of software, hardware, and non fiction books, articles, and documentaries.  There will also be bounties for the first people to help with new projects.<br>
<br>
There won't be any bounties for fiction, because you can't pay someone to create something no one has thought of before; you can only support those who did.  Developers who produce fiction will get a share of the devcoin generation as do developers who produce non fiction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Essential<br>
<br>
Bounties are primarily for those essential developments which many other developments depend on.<br>
<br>
For example, the most essential program in the software world is the compiler.  Without the compiler we wouldn't have bitcoin, or any other software.  The compiler is not the biggest software project, but it is vital and if there were bounties at the dawn of computing, a big part should of gone to developing the compiler.<br>
<br>
Today, the most essential software in early development is bitcoin.  With bitcoin people can pay each other across the world and accomplish projects which no one could of developed alone.  For example, without being able to pay bitcoin bounties, devcoin and the associated charity mining pools could not of been created because no one person had the skills or the time to develop the entire project.<br>
<br>
The most essential hardware tool is that which can build other tools.  There are open source tools like the <a href='http://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a>, <a href='http://www.contraptor.org/'>Contraptor</a>, <a href='http://www.buildlog.net/'>CNC Laser</a>, <a href='http://opensourcemachine.org/'>Multimachine</a>, <a href='http://128.95.165.38/'>Powder Printer</a>, and <a href='http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Reprap</a> that can build parts or control machine tools.  However those projects are progressing slowly because they get only a tiny amount of money for development.  Also, there is no open source tool that can print metal parts, or microfabricate.<br>

Stages<br>
<br>
The initial bounties are for charity pools, the first inductees and a devcoin block explorer.<br>
<br>
The first five charity pools which generate a block will get five million devcoins, then four million, three million, two million, and finally one million.  The devcoins will be split half with the operator of the pool, and half with the first twenty five users of each pool.  So the first twenty five users of the first pool would get one hundred thousand devcoins each, the first users of the next pool would get eighty thousand devcoins each, then sixty thousand, forty thousand, and finally twenty thousand.<br>
<br>
The first five software or hardware developers inducted will get one million devcoins each.  The first five writers inducted will also get one million each.
<br>
Finally, there will be a five million devcoin bounty for an open source devcoin block explorer.<br>
<br>
The next set of bounties will be to make it easier for people to access open content, to communicate and to vote.  The initial hardware bounties will also be posted, although it is expected that it will be at least several months before the hardware developments are even partly accomplished.<br>
<br>
There will be a bounty for making a web site where all devcoin qualifying writing could be uploaded.  The web site would have limited advertising (only text ads or a single non animated banner ad), which would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed among the writers.<br>
<br>
There will be a bounty for a forum site which requires bitcoins / devcoins to join and post, the money would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed according to the wishes of the posters.<br>
<br>
There will be a bounty for a 0 to 99 range voting site, and/or for incorporating range voting into existing forum software.<br>
<br>
The hardware bounties are for the missing open source tools, a metal printer and a microfabricator.  There will be a ten million devcoin bounty for the first open source printer that can print zinc or <a href='http://www.gizmology.net/stovetop.htm'>zinc alloy</a> parts.  For printers that can print parts out of metals with higher melting points, they will get an additional bounty of ten thousand devcoin per degree Celcius of the melting point of the metal above four hundred Celcius (roughly the melting point of zinc).<br>
<br>
The microfabricator bounty will be two million devcoins for an open source 3D printer that can print with a feature size of eight hundred microns.  There will be an additional bounty of two million devcoins for each halving of that feature size.  So a printer which can print at four hundred microns would get four million, at two hundred microns six million, etc..  If the printer can achieve an intermediate feature size, then the bounty would be the logarithmic interpolation.  If the printer prints at a different feature size in one dimension than another, then the effective feature size will be the cube of an equal volume.<br>
<br>
Later on there will be bounties for a web email which requires coins to join and post, the money would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed to charity.  Software upgrades to the mainline client to make it more difficult to double spend.  Software changes to the mainline client to make it easier to make alternative clients.  Expansion of the devcoin writer web site to also host music, art and movies.<br>
<br>
In the long term, bounties for improvements of open source software in general.  Bounties for open source machinery, circuits, vehicles, housing, games and medicine.  Bounties for open source villages and other types of communities.  Bounties for open source transportation, energy and resource extraction systems.  The ultimate purpose of the bounties is to fund all kinds of open source development, so that people could choose to live in an open source community where everything therein could be developed or built by anyone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Value<br>
<br>
The value of a devcoin will be set by the market.  The value will vary and there is no way to predict with certainty what the value will be in the future.<br>
<br>
The closest type of coin to devcoin is namecoin.  The value of namecoin when the namecoin market started was in the neighbourhood of <a href='http://www.nmcwatch.com/index.php?c=bpx&tf=1d'>0.005 BTC.</a>  Devcoin generation is one thousand times greater than bitcoin or namecoin generation, so the equivalent neighbourhood would be 0.000005 DVC/BTC, giving a reciprocal of 200,000 DVC/BTC.  This does no mean you can rely or even estimate that devcoin will have that value, this is just a reminder of how namecoin started.<br>
