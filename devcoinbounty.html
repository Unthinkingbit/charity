<title>Devcoin Bounty</title></head>
<body>
Introduction<br>
<br>
Devcoin is an ethical currency where 90% of the generation goes to open source developers and about a quarter of that will go to bounties.<br>
<br>
The bounties will be primarily for development of software, hardware, and non fiction books, articles, and documentaries.  There will also be bounties for the first people to help with new projects.<br>
<br>
There won't be any bounties for fiction, because you can't pay someone to create something no one has thought of before; you can only support those who did, afterwards.  Developers who produce fiction will get a share of the devcoin generation as do developers who produce non fiction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Essential<br>
<br>
Bounties are primarily for those essential developments which many other developments depend on.<br>
<br>
For example, the most essential program in the software world is the compiler.  Without the compiler we wouldn't have bitcoin, or any other software.  The compiler is not the biggest software project, but it is vital and if there were bounties at the dawn of computing, a big part should of gone to developing the compiler.<br>
<br>
Today, the most essential software in early development is bitcoin.  With bitcoin people can pay each other across the world and accomplish projects which no one could of developed alone.  For example, without being able to pay bitcoin bounties, devcoin and the associated charity mining pools could not of been created because no one person had the skills or the time to develop the entire project.<br>

Concerns<br>
Bounties<br>
<br>
The initial bounties are for making a web site where all devcoin qualifying writing could be uploaded.  The web site would have limited advertising (only text ads or a single non animated banner ad), which would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed among the writers.  The next bounty is for an open source devcoin block explorer.<br>
<br>
The medium term bounties are for a forum site which requires bitcoins / devcoins to join and post, the money would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed according to the wishes of the posters.  A web email which requires coins to join and post, the money would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed to charity.  Software upgrades to the mainline client to make it more difficult to double spend.  Software changes to the mainline client to make it easier to make alternative clients.  Expansion of the devcoin writer web site to also host music, art and movies.<br>
<br>
In the long term, bounties for improvements of open source software in general.  Bounties for open source machinery, circuits, vehicles, housing, games and medicine.  Bounties for open source villages and other types of communities.  Bounties for open source transportation, energy and resource extraction systems.  The ultimate purpose of the bounties is to fund all kinds of open source development, so that people could choose to live in an open source community where everything therein could be developed or built by anyone.<br>
