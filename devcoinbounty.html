<title>Devcoin Bounty</title></head>
<body>
Introduction<br>
<br>
Devcoin is an ethical currency where 90% of the generation goes to open source developers and about a quarter of that will go to bounties.<br>
<br>
The bounties will be primarily for development of software, hardware, and non fiction books, articles, and documentaries.  There will also be bounties for the first people to help with new projects.<br>
<br>
There won't be any bounties for fiction; because you can't pay someone to create a fiction to a specification and expect a great work; you can only support those who created fiction of their own imagining.  Developers who produce fiction will get a share of the devcoin generation as do developers who produce non fiction.<br>
<br>
<br>
Essential<br>
<br>
Bounties are primarily for those essential developments which many other developments depend on.<br>
<br>
For example, the most essential program in the software world is the compiler.  Without the compiler we wouldn't have bitcoin, or any other software.  The compiler is not the biggest software project, but it is vital and if there were bounties at the dawn of computing, a big part should of gone to developing the compiler.<br>
<br>
Today, the most essential software in early development is bitcoin.  With bitcoin people can pay each other across the world and accomplish projects which no one could of developed alone.  For example, without being able to pay bitcoin bounties, devcoin and the associated charity mining pools could not of been created because no one person had the skills or the time to develop the entire project.<br>
<br>
The most essential hardware tool is that which can build other tools.  There are open source tools like the <a href='http://www.arduino.cc/'>Arduino</a>, <a href='http://www.contraptor.org/'>Contraptor</a>, <a href='http://www.buildlog.net/'>CNC Laser</a>, <a href='http://opensourcemachine.org/'>Multimachine</a>, <a href='http://128.95.165.38/'>Powder Printer</a>, and <a href='http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Reprap</a> that can build parts or control machine tools.  However those projects are progressing slowly because they get only a tiny amount of money for development.  Also, there is no open source tool that can print metal parts, or microfabricate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Helpful<br>
<br>
A web site for open source authors to post their articles and/or have articles pulled from their blogs would help writers.  Also forums where people have to pay to post, which reduces spam, and the money paid is directed by the votes of the posters would help develop projects.<br>
<br>
Finally, the more money your computer makes the better.  Bitcoin gives miners money for their GPU, but the GPU money will decrease as the bitcoin block subsidy is halved.  To that end there will be bounties for development of open source projects which could lead to people getting paid for their computing cycles, like the <a href='http://burp.renderfarming.net/'>Big Ugly Rendering Farm (BURP).</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Stages<br>
<br>
The initial bounties are for charity pools, the first inductees and a devcoin block explorer.<br>
<br>
The first five charity pools which generate a block will get five million devcoins, then four million, three million, two million, and finally one million.  The devcoins will be split half with the operator of the pool, and half with the first twenty five users of each pool.  So the first twenty five users of the first pool would get one hundred thousand devcoins each, the first users of the next pool would get eighty thousand devcoins each, then sixty thousand, forty thousand, and finally twenty thousand.<br>
<br>
The first five software or hardware developers inducted will get one million devcoins each.  The first five writers inducted will also get one million each.
<br>
Finally, there will be a five million devcoin bounty for an open source devcoin block explorer.<br>
<br>
The next set of bounties will be to make it easier for people to access open content, to communicate and to vote.  The initial hardware bounties will also be posted, although it is expected that it will be at least several months before the hardware developments are even partly accomplished.<br>
<br>
There will be a bounty for making a web site where all devcoin qualifying writing could be uploaded and/or the web site would poll the author's sites for new articles.  The web site would have limited advertising (only text ads or a single non animated banner ad), which would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed among the writers.<br>
<br>
There will be a bounty for a forum site which requires bitcoins / devcoins to join and post, the money would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed according to the wishes of the posters.<br>
<br>
There will be a bounty for a 0 to 99 range voting site, and/or for incorporating range voting into existing forum software.<br>
<br>
The hardware bounties are for the missing open source tools, a metal printer and a microfabricator.  There will be a ten million devcoin bounty for the first open source printer that can print zinc or <a href='http://www.gizmology.net/stovetop.htm'>zinc alloy</a> parts.  For printers that can print parts out of metals with higher melting points, they will get an additional bounty of ten thousand devcoin per degree Celcius of the melting point of the metal above four hundred Celcius (roughly the melting point of zinc).<br>
<br>
The microfabricator bounty will be two million devcoins for an open source 3D printer that can print with a feature size of eight hundred microns.  There will be an additional bounty of two million devcoins for each halving of that feature size.  So a printer which can print at four hundred microns would get four million, at two hundred microns six million, etc..  If the printer can achieve an intermediate feature size, then the bounty would be the logarithmic interpolation.  If the printer prints at a different feature size in one dimension than another, then the effective feature size will be the cube of an equal volume.<br>
<br>
Later on there will be bounties for a web email which requires coins to join and post, the money would support the site, any remaining income would be distributed to charity.  Software upgrades to the mainline client to make it more difficult to double spend.  Software changes to the mainline client to make it easier to make alternative clients.  Expansion of the devcoin writer web site to also host music, art and movies.<br>
<br>
In the long term, bounties for improvements of open source software in general.  Bounties for open source machinery, circuits, vehicles, housing, games and medicine.  Bounties for open source villages and other types of communities.  Bounties for open source transportation, energy and resource extraction systems.  The ultimate purpose of the bounties is to fund all kinds of open source development, so that people could choose to live in an open source community where everything therein could be developed or built by anyone.<br>
<br>
<br>
Value<br>
<br>
The value of a devcoin will be set by the market.  The value will vary and there is no way to predict with certainty what the value will be in the future.<br>
<br>
The closest type of coin to devcoin is namecoin.  The value of namecoin when the namecoin market started was in the neighbourhood of <a href='http://www.nmcwatch.com/index.php?c=bpx&tf=1d'>0.005 BTC.</a>  Devcoin generation is one thousand times greater than bitcoin or namecoin generation, so the equivalent neighbourhood would be 0.000005 DVC/BTC, giving a reciprocal of 200,000 DVC/BTC.  This does no mean you can rely or even estimate that devcoin will have that value, this is just a reminder of how namecoin started.<br>
<br>
<br>
Administration<br>
<br>
Administrators who disburse bounties get 10% of the disbursement, which means for bounties administrators get 1/11 of the money allocated for bounties and the receivers get 10/11.  If a ten thousand devcoin bounty is disbursed, the administrator would get one thousand devcoins.  This is different than the formula for shares where the administrators get 1/10 and the developers get 9/10, it is so that the administrators get a round number of devcoins for a round number bounty.<br>
<br>
To be able to disburse bounties quickly, a bounty administrator would be given an amount of devcoins less than half of their active developer share in the current funding round.  The bounty administrator is given less than half so that if they run off with the bounty coins, their future active developer share can be garnished for that amount.<br>
<br>
When the bounty adminstrator releases a bounty greater than the coins they have on hand, they release the coins they have on hand to the recipient and the balance is paid out of the next bounty funding round.<br>
<br>
In the development of devcoin and the related charity pool, five people accomplished more than mechanical tasks and qualified for creative work bounties, for which there can be no absolutely objective criteria.  Three accepted the offered bounties, gracefully with no complaints or requests for more.  Two developers withheld their work while asking for a greater share.<br>
<br>
Since some developers will withhold their work while asking for more, the bounty administrator must make public offers of the bounty, only for work which has been released, and ask for acceptance of the bounty amount.  The bounty must not be released in whole or in part to anyone who withholds their work or does not agree with the amount offered, because any additional bounty to those who withhold would come from the share of the honest and generous developers.<br>
<br>
A bounty administrator's decision for a bounty can not be overriden.  If someone thinks a bounty administrator is corrupt; for example there is evidence of a kickback, they can advance 50 $ to have three other administrators vote on whether there really is corruption.  If the defendant gets 50% or more, the defendant stays; any new accusations within a month require a cumulative doubling of the last advance.  If the advance reaches 200 $, the a five member jury is chosen, at 800 $ a seven member jury is chosen, and so on for each quadrupling.  If the defendent gets 40% to 50%, they can not administer another bounty for three months and can apply for a new vote afterwards.  If the defendent gets less than 40%, they can not adminster another bounty for a year and can apply for a new vote afterwards.  If the vote is below 50%, the money is returned to the accuser, if the vote is 50% or over, the administrators vote on whether the money should be returned to the accuser or distributed among the active developers.  So an accuser can try to stop a bounty administrator from making another bad or corrupt decision, but an accuser can not change the disbursement of the current bounty.  This is to reduce the incentive for a developer who wants more money to repeatedly appeal hoping to eventually get a jury to rule in his favor.<br>
